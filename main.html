  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
  <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems, building things that help people, and continuously learning new technologies. Writing code lets me turn ideas into working applications, collaborate with others, and create tools that can make everyday tasks easier or more enjoyable. The constant challenge and creative problem-solving in development keep me motivated and excited about the future.
